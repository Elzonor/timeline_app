# PostgreSQL rules

- Use appropriate data types (e.g., SERIAL for IDs, specialized types like JSONB, POINT when appropriate)
- Create indexes for frequently queried columns (B-tree for equality/range, GIN for full-text search)
- Use constraints to enforce data integrity (CHECK, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE)
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to optimize queries
- Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex queries
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Use JSON functions for working with JSON data
- Use transactions for operations that must be atomic
